// The argument ("login-modal-context") is a string identifier for this context,
// and it is used internally by Qwik as a label or key.
//
// The actual context identifier "We" use, is the constant "GlobalContext".
// NOT THE STRING ("login-modal-context") ITSELF.
//
// We pass `GlobalContext` (the constant) to `useContext()` in order to use this context in different components.
// `GlobalContext` (the constant) bundles together both the string identifier and the associated type.
//
// By passing `ModalContext` (the constant) to `useContext`, we get the benefits of TypeScript's type safety.
// The createContextId function ties the string identifier to a specific type,
// ensuring that whenever we use this context in our app,
// TypeScript can check that we're accessing and modifying the context's state correctly.
// If we were to pass a string like `"login-modal-context"` directly, we would lose the type safety that TypeScript provides,
// and the association between the string and its corresponding data structure would be more fragile.
//
// The string identifier is helpful for debugging purposes.
// In Qwikâ€™s internal tooling or logs, we might see references to this string, which helps us track down which context is being used.
